# MacBook notch widget visual review

Native macOS captures on Apple Silicon M2 with hardware camera notch (macOS Sequoia) comparing `main` baseline with the `feature/mac-notch-widget` candidate branch.

Open `review.html` in any browser to inspect the matching captures with the Theme (Dark / Light), Window size (Normal / Narrow), and Revision (Before / After) controls.

## Visible Scope & Spoty Design System Alignment

- **Seek Bar:** 4pt seek bar matching Spoty's own `thin_slider` (shape, height, solid white progress fill, and 6pt radius solid white thumb handle drawn unconditionally) rather than an uncharacteristic wavy design.
- **Card Controls & Styling:**
  - Spoty's native Lucide outlined SVG icons from `assets/icons/` (`heart.svg`, `skip-back.svg`, `skip-forward.svg`, `play-filled.svg`, `pause-filled.svg`, `shuffle.svg`, `repeat.svg`, `repeat-1.svg`, `speaker.svg`).
  - Inter font (`fastframe_fonts::INTER`) matching the application shell and player bar.
  - Active buttons (shuffle, repeat, liked song, remote Connect target) highlighted in Spoty green (`#1ed760`); inactive controls rendered in crisp translucent white.
  - 36pt circular disc button (`theme::circle_button`) for Play/Pause.
  - Time indicators show elapsed time and total duration (`m:ss`) matching the player bar.
  - 18pt corner radius and 1px outline border matching Spoty floating modals.
- **Resource Discipline:**
  - Window and tracking run entirely through native macOS AppKit hooks with zero idle wakeups.
  - Fast repaint is only scheduled while the notch card is actively expanding or animating.
